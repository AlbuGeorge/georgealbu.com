              Hey! I'm George Albu, I've been close to a computer since an early
              age, and been passionate about it ever since.
            </p>

              I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools, started with
              Wordpress and from that, I explored how to code myself,
              fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and
              technologies. I'm interested in building something awesome with
              code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web
              Development.
            </p>

              {' '}
              When I'm not coding I like going to the gym, watch some show on
              Netflix, or if the weather's good, play different sports! 🏓🎾
